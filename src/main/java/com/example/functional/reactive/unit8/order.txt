1. SPliterator  ; Implement spliterator to connect Stream to custom source. follow example
                1. charactristics of stream eg ordered , sorted helps in processing the stream
                    for example spliterator on list stream will have default order and for Treeset it will be sorted
                    if you apply treeset.stream().sorted().count() -> sorted() will not be executed
                    since Treeset is already sorted so optimization is implemented this way
